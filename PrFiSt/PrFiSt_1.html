        <h2>Basic Flow of Program Events</h2>

        <h3>Animal Input & Profile Setup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Animal ID Assignment:</strong> Assign a unique ID to each animal to track its data consistently. This step is critical before or as part of data entry to ensure each animal's data is uniquely identifiable.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Ensure that all input data (age, breed, health status, etc.) is validated to prevent incorrect or incomplete entries.</li>
            <li><strong>Health History Input:</strong> Input any previous illnesses or medical history that could help in anomaly detection. This historical data can provide context for detecting future health issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral & Health Baseline:</strong> Define the animal's initial behaviors (e.g., resting heart rate, eating habits) and health conditions, which will be used for comparison when abnormalities are detected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tracker Setup & Configuration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tracker Configuration and Calibration:</strong> Calibrate the trackers (accelerometers, gyroscopes) based on the animal’s unique needs, such as size, activity level, and physiological requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Fault Detection:</strong> Continuously monitor tracker performance for issues like low battery or signal loss to maintain data integrity and reliable functioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Considerations:</strong> Ensure trackers are rugged and able to withstand environmental stresses, such as temperature changes and external wear.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Network Connectivity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WiFi/Network Provider Setup:</strong> Connect the trackers to a stable network that handles raw data transmission, using secure networking protocols for traffic management.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Pass unprocessed raw data from unique trackers to the backend system for further processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Data:</strong> Capture and transmit real-time data regarding the animal’s position and motion (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope readings) to ensure accurate tracking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backend System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Raw Data Storage:</strong> Collect and store raw data in a structured format, tied to the unique animal ID for traceability.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Translation:</strong> Translate the raw data into behavioral patterns and movements, applying predefined quantifiers and logic that are unique to each animal and based on its baseline.</li>
            <li><strong>Processed Data Storage:</strong> Store the processed data alongside the animal's unique ID and a time reference, enabling accurate tracking over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Summary:</strong> Consolidate daily data into a summarized format, making it easily accessible for future analysis or comparison.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Machine Learning (ML) Processing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Train an ML model to analyze raw data and predict actions or events for each individual animal. This includes regular updates based on newly collected data.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Base Model Creation:</strong> Create a standard baseline of healthy behaviors for each animal, using historical data for reference. The model should be regularly updated to reflect changes in the animal's health over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Behavior Comparison:</strong> Compare new raw data with the standard healthy base to detect behavioral changes or health anomalies.</li>
            <li><strong>Tuning for Accuracy:</strong> Tune the model's output to consider all possible variables, including external events, to ensure correct predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Train the model to recognize movement patterns or behavioral characteristics that may indicate an animal is unwell, and compare incoming raw data against these patterns to trigger alerts.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> The processing database is updated in real-time to reflect the latest data, with the model continually assessing the animal’s status based on preset parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Provide the ability to validate or correct the model's predictions through user feedback, improving the accuracy of future reports and alert generation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Database Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Archiving & Backup:</strong> Implement periodic archiving of data for long-term analysis and backup systems to prevent data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Structured Data Format:</strong> Ensure data is stored in structured formats like JSON or XML for easy retrieval via APIs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pre-Backend Server</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Management:</strong> Handle authentication, rate limiting, and session management (cookies and timeouts) to ensure secure and efficient data access.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> Interpret API calls to retrieve individual animal data or generate general average data based on the animal ID as requested by the frontend.</li>
            <li><strong>Structured Data Delivery:</strong> Pass the requested data in a structured format (JSON or XML) to the frontend for display and further analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frontend User Interface</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Secure user login with role-based permissions (admin, veterinarian, user) to ensure controlled access to data.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracker Management:</strong> Allow users to add, update, or remove trackers as needed, ensuring they can manage the system efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Data Visualization:</strong> Display movement patterns, heart rate, and other relevant data in easy-to-understand graphical formats for immediate assessment.</li>
            <li><strong>Alert Management & Feedback:</strong> Provide alerts for behaviors that need attention, and allow users to validate or provide feedback on the accuracy of the reports. This assists in model updating and continuous learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Health Trends Dashboard:</strong> Provide long-term data visualization to help identify potential health issues or trends over weeks or months.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Export:</strong> Enable users to download reports or raw data for further analysis or record-keeping.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Testing & Validation:</strong> Run controlled tests to validate the system’s functionality and stress-test the system for scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with External Medical Systems:</strong> Integrate with veterinary software for a more comprehensive view of animal health, potentially automating the generation and export of alerts.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Context Awareness:</strong> Factor in environmental variables (e.g., weather, time of day, external stressors) that may impact behavior, improving anomaly detection accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Alerts:</strong> Send alerts to authorized personnel (e.g., caretakers, veterinarians) when potential health issues are detected.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Generation:</strong> Generate detailed reports that include movement data, anomaly detection results, and suggested actions for the caretakers or veterinarians.</li>
            <li><strong>Disease Prediction:</strong> Over time, the system can predict the likelihood of specific illnesses based on detected patterns and historical data, helping with proactive health management.</li>
        </ul>
